# Vibe Coding Tutorial Project Files

This repository contains the source code and project files accompanying my "Vibe Coding" tutorial video.

**What is Vibe Coding?**

In this tutorial series (link to your video here!), I explore a more intuitive and expressive approach to coding, which I call "vibe coding." It's about letting your creativity and personal style influence your development process, focusing on the feeling and aesthetic of your code and the resulting projects. We'll delve into techniques like [mention 1-2 key techniques you cover, e.g., generative algorithms, creative use of libraries, focusing on visual/auditory feedback].

**What's Inside This Folder?**

This folder contains all the necessary files to follow along with the tutorial and experiment with the concepts discussed. You'll find:

* **`[Project Name 1]/`**: (If you have a specific project) Contains the source code, assets (images, sounds, etc.), and any necessary project files for the first project demonstrated in the video.
    * `main.py` (or your main code file extension): The primary Python (or other language) script.
    * `assets/`: (Optional) A subfolder containing images, audio files, or other resources.
    * `README.md`: (Optional) A specific README for this sub-project with more details.
* **`[Project Name 2]/`**: (If you have another distinct project) Similar structure to the first project.
* **`[Utility Scripts]/`**: (Optional) May contain smaller, reusable scripts or code snippets discussed in the video.
* **`requirements.txt`**: (If applicable) Lists the Python libraries required to run the code. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **`LICENSE`**: (Optional) Specifies the licensing for this code. Consider using a permissive open-source license like MIT or Apache 2.0.

**Getting Started**

1.  **Watch the Tutorial:** Make sure to watch the corresponding "Vibe Coding" tutorial video (link here!) to understand the concepts and how the code is developed.
2.  **Download the Repository:** Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [your repository URL]
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the Project Folder:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the specific project folder you want to explore (e.g., `cd [Project Name 1]`).
4.  **Install Dependencies (if applicable):** If a `requirements.txt` file exists, install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Run the Code:** Execute the main script using the appropriate command for your programming language (e.g., `python main.py`).
6.  **Experiment and Explore:** Feel free to modify the code, try different parameters, and see how it affects the "vibe" of the project!
